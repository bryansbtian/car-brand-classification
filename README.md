# Car Brand Classification: An Introductory Project to Computer Vision Using Transfer Learning and CNNs

This project aims to introduce beginners with little to no machine learning experience to the fundamentals of computer vision through a hands-on, practical application. The objective is to develop a multi-class image classification model that can identify the make of a car from an input image using Python and PyTorch.

The project guides participants through the process of using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, leveraging transfer learning by applying the ResNet-50 pre-trained model. By the end of this project, participants will have:

- A foundational understanding of key concepts in computer vision.
- Practical experience in model deployment.
- A unique project to showcase on a resume.
